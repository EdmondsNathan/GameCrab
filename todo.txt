* Implement PPU
* Implement input
* Refactor CPU to use micro ops rather than function pointers. This should make it far more readable
* Refactor fetch, decode, execute loop. Remove Instruction enums completely and have the decoder directly call the instruction queueing functions
* Implement some debugging tools such as pausing, step, and better logging
* Implement audio

# GameCrab 🎮
GameCrab is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust with the Macroquad framework.

## Cycle Accurate 🚲
The emulator aims for cycle-accuracy, allowing it to emulate games as accurately as possible.

## Current Status 🗓️
The project is still in the very early stages. Right now I am working on implementing the CPU. I plan to make a blog post detailing the current state of the project in the near future, so stay tuned for that!
